This folder includes relevant codes to process data and generate analysis
results in Li and Cohen, JGR, 2021.

The main scripts include:

1. MonthlyProcess.py: read satellite and reanalysis files and calculate
monthly mean fields of AOD/sulfate mass/SO2 mass.

inputs:
UVdir: folder of ERA5 wind fields
CPdir: folder of ERA5 cloud and precipitation fiels
RHdir: folder of ERA5 Relative Humidity
Caliopdir: folder of CALIPSO level 3 data
Satdir: folder of MODIS/OMI satellite data
outtop: output directory

parser params:
--year --month: YYYYMM to identifile files to accumulate
--Var: SO2 or AOD
--level: an string indicator that will be used creat a folder under the output
directory, which defines the pressure range when constructing the aerosol
fields (sulfate mass or AOD) included. See the code ('if level==...') for
details
--DoBeta: if True calculate sulfate mass from AOD, if False, directly
accumulate AOD
--DoCaliop: if True use CALIOP profile to slice AOD vertically, should be True
if 'level' is not 'All'

The output files are monthly fields in netCDF4 format.

2. FluxFit.py: read the calculated mass and flux fields vs. plume age as from
MonthlyProcess.py and do the Fit of SO2 and aerosol lifetime

Pdir: corresponding to the "outtop" directory in MonthlyProcess.py

parser params:
--year --month --level --DoBeta : same meaning as in MonthlyProcess.py
--subdir : the program will creat a directory under the "level" directory to
generate output txt files that record the fitting params
--DoDiff: (experimental) whether use the difference between e.g.2008 and low-volcanic
activity years (e.g. 2005-2007) to calculate plume flux, default is False
